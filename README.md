1. **HolteWinters_Capstone_Project**
   
    This project applies Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters method) to forecast monthly airmiles data. The dataset is preprocessed by converting it
    to a monthly frequency and analyzed for seasonality using ACF, PACF, and seasonal decomposition. The model is trained using an additive trend and multiplicative
    seasonality with a period of 12 months. The final model's performance is assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),
    and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), alongside visualizations comparing actual and predicted values.
    This approach helps understand seasonal trends in air travel demand and improves forecasting accuracy.
